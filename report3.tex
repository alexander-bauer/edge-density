\section*{Dense Edges as a Measure of Clutter}

In an earlier report, I examined the edges in the images as detected by the Canny
edge detector. Inspecting the edges, I recognized that areas I knew to be
clutter had dense lines. These areas then had a high response to averaging using
a box filter. Points to classify as clutter were then identified using a
binary threshold.

Preliminary results using this method are shown overlaid on the source images
below.

        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_00.jpg} &
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_01.jpg} &
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_02.jpg} \\
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_03.jpg} &
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_04.jpg} &
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_05.jpg} \\
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_06.jpg} &
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_07.jpg} &
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\hsize]{results/dense_edges/occupied_08.jpg} \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

This produces surprisingly complete true positives; almost all of ground truth
patches of clutter. However, it identifies many false positives, mostly in wall
hangings and light fixtures. I would like to explore methods for reducing the
number these false positives.

Additionally, I have started working on code to automatically construct a
panorama from the given images. Although not applicable to all settings, use of
a panorama would make sense for the security camera data I currently have to
work with.

At this point in the project, I am considering giving up on human detection.
Other libraries exist to track motion and detect pedestrians, and my efforts
tuning detectors seem to be wasted.
