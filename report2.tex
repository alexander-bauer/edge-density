    \LARGE Occupancy and ``Clutter'' Detection for Home Automation \\
    Report 2
\end{center}

Since the past report, I have worked on clutter detection, and have explored a
number of avenues, including the Fourier domain, and counting edges yielded by
Canny edge detection. The best results have been achieved using Harris corner
detection and counting the resulting number of corners in small sliding windows.

As shown below, I get very noisy results using this method, though. Spots with
dense clusters of corners are shown below in red. Some piles of clutter are
correctly identified, but many are not, and there are numerous false positives.

Another method I intend to explore is histograms of oriented gradients. My
hypothesis is that cluttered areas will have ``noisy'' HOGs, with gradients
oriented in many directions in roughly even numbers. I may be able to apply
machine learning to this problem, also.
