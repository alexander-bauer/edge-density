    \LARGE Occupancy and ``Clutter'' Detection for Home Automation \\
    Report 1
\end{center}

Research up to this point has focused on occupancy detection only. In the mean
time, I have completed some administrative tasks, such as starting a GitHub
repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/alexander-bauer/occupancy-and-clutter-detection}}
and installing a camera.

The GitHub repository contains a handful of source images captured from the
research camera, including both occupied and un-occupied scenes. I have
implemented a primitive occupancy detector, and tested it without great success
on my sample images. At present, it results in very high rates of
false-positives, and fails to detect either occupant.

The current results of the occupancy detector on the data set is shown below.
Green boxes indicate strong belief an occupant is present, red indicates a weak
belief. My roommates Mark and Dylan are featured.

Further refinement will require tuning of parameters, and testing with a wider
range of data. I hope to expand my training set to include obviously visible and
posed occupants, as well as partially-obscured, seated, and standing
individuals. My poor initial results concern me, but I have yet to deeply
investigate parameter tuning for the HOG person detector.

One avenue I would like to explore is combining these frames from a rotated
camera into a single scene, and determine how that affects performance and
accuracy of occupancy searching. It would also provide a more convenient
interface in software for determining whether an entire scene contains an
occupant, rather than for individual frames.

Techniques for clutter analysis remain unexplored for the time being, but
hopefully more resources will be available for them now that several
administrative tasks are out of the way.
